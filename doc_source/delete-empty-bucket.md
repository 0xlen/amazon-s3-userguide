# Using the AWS SDK Java<a name="delete-empty-bucket"></a>

The following example shows you how to delete a bucket using the AWS SDK for Java\. First, the code deletes objects in the bucket and then it deletes the bucket\. For information about other AWS SDKs, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/)\.

#### [ Java ]

The following Java example deletes a bucket that contains objects\. The example deletes all objects, and then it deletes the bucket\. The example works for buckets with or without versioning enabled\.

**Note**  
For buckets without versioning enabled, you can delete all objects directly and then delete the bucket\. For buckets with versioning enabled, you must delete all object versions before deleting the bucket\.

For instructions on creating and testing a working sample, see [Testing the Amazon S3 Java Code Examples](UsingTheMPJavaAPI.md#TestingJavaSamples)\.
