# Using bucket policies<a name="bucket-policies"></a>

You can create and configure bucket policies to grant permission to your Amazon S3 resources\. Bucket policies use JSON\-based access policy language\. 

The topics in this section provide examples and show you how to add a bucket policy in the S3 console\. For information about IAM user policies, see [Using IAM user policies](user-policies.md)\. For information about bucket policy language, see [Policies and Permissions in Amazon S3](access-policy-language-overview.md)

**Important**  
Bucket policies are limited to 20 KB in size\.
