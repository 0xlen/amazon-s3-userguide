# Deleting object versions from a versioning\-enabled bucket<a name="DeletingObjectVersions"></a>

You can delete object versions from Amazon S3 buckets whenever you want\. You can also define lifecycle configuration rules for objects that have a well\-defined lifecycle to request Amazon S3 to expire current object versions or permanently remove noncurrent object versions\. When your bucket is version\-enabled or versioning is suspended, the lifecycle configuration actions work as follows:
+ The `Expiration` action applies to the current object version\. Instead of deleting the current object version, Amazon S3 retains the current version as a noncurrent version by adding a delete marker, which then becomes the current version\.
+ The `NoncurrentVersionExpiration` action applies to noncurrent object versions, and Amazon S3 permanently removes these object versions\. You cannot recover permanently removed objects\.

For more information, see [Managing your storage lifecycle](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md)\.

## Delete request use cases<a name="delete-request-use-cases"></a>

A `DELETE` request has the following use cases:
+ When versioning is enabled, a simple `DELETE` cannot permanently delete an object\. 

  Instead, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker in the bucket, and that marker becomes the current version of the object with a new ID\. When you try to `GET` an object whose current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as though the object has been deleted \(even though it has not been erased\) and returns a 404 error\. 

  The following figure shows that a simple `DELETE` does not actually remove the specified object\. Instead, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker\.

+ To delete versioned objects permanently, you must use `DELETE Object versionId`\.

  The following figure shows that deleting a specified object version permanently removes that object\.

## To delete object versions<a name="delete-object-version"></a>

You can delete object versions in Amazon S3 using the console, AWS SDKs, or the REST API\.

### Using the S3 console<a name="deleting-object-versions"></a>

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the **Buckets** list, choose the name of the bucket that contains the object\.

1. In the **Objects** list, choose the name of the object\.

1. Choose **Versions**\.

   Amazon S3 shows all the versions for the object\.

1. Select the check box next to the **Version ID** for the versions that you want to retrieve\.

1. Choose **Delete**\.

1. In **Permanently delete objects?**, enter **permanently delete**\.
**Warning**  
When you permanently delete an object version, the action cannot be undone\.

1. Choose **Delete objects**\.

   Amazon S3 deletes the object version\.

### Using the AWS SDKs<a name="delete-obj-version-version-enabled-bucket-sdks"></a>

For examples of deleting objects using the AWS SDKs for Java, \.NET, and PHP, see [Deleting Amazon S3 objects](DeletingObjects.md)\. The examples for deleting objects in nonversioned and versioning\-enabled buckets are the same\. However, for versioning\-enabled buckets, Amazon S3 assigns a version number\. Otherwise, the version number is null\. 

For information about using other AWS SDKs, see [Sample Code and Libraries](https://aws.amazon.com/code/)\. 

### Using the REST API<a name="delete-obj-version-enabled-bucket-rest"></a>

**To a delete a specific version of an object**
+ In a `DELETE`, specify a version ID\.

**Example â€” Deleting a specific version**  
The following example shows how to delete version `UIORUnfnd89493jJFJ` of `photo.gif`\.  

```
1. DELETE /photo.gif?versionId=UIORUnfnd89493jJFJ HTTP/1.1 
2. Host: bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
3. Date: Wed, 12 Oct 2009 17:50:00 GMT
4. Authorization: AWS AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:xQE0diMbLRepdf3YB+FIEXAMPLE=
