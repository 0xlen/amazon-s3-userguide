# Uploading, downloading, and working with objects in Amazon S3<a name="uploading-downloading-objects"></a>

To store your data in Amazon S3, you work with resources known as buckets and objects\. A *bucket* is a container for objects\. An *object* is a file and any metadata that describes that file\.

To store an object in Amazon S3, you create a bucket and then upload the object to a bucket\. When the object is in the bucket, you can open it, download it, and move it\. When you no longer need an object or a bucket, you can clean up these resources\.

With Amazon S3, you pay only for what you use\. For more information about Amazon S3 features and pricing, see [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3)\. If you are a new Amazon S3 customer, you can get started with Amazon S3 for free\. For more information, see [AWS Free Tier](http://aws.amazon.com/free)\.
