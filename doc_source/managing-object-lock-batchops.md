# Managing S3 Object Lock using S3 Batch Operations<a name="managing-object-lock-batchops"></a>

S3 Object Lock enables you to place a legal hold on an object version\. Like setting a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted\. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed\. 

You can use S3 Batch Operations with Object Lock to add legal holds to *many* Amazon S3 objects at once\.

For more information, see [S3 Object Lock legal hold](batch-ops-legal-hold.md)\.
